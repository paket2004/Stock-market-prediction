    Typing a step input to have this type will cause ZenML to not materialize
    the artifact. This is useful for steps that need to access the artifact
    metadata instead of the actual artifact data.

    Usage example:

    ```python
    from zenml import step
    from zenml.artifacts.unmaterialized_artifact import UnmaterializedArtifact

    @step
    def my_step(input_artifact: UnmaterializedArtifact):
        print(input_artifact.uri)
