class SkypilotBaseOrchestratorSettings(BaseSettings):
    """Skypilot orchestrator base settings.

    Attributes:
        instance_type: the instance type to use.
        cpus: the number of CPUs required for the task.
            If a str, must be a string of the form `'2'` or `'2+'`, where
            the `+` indicates that the task requires at least 2 CPUs.
        memory: the amount of memory in GiB required. If a
            str, must be a string of the form `'16'` or `'16+'`, where
            the `+` indicates that the task requires at least 16 GB of memory.
        accelerators: the accelerators required. If a str, must be
            a string of the form `'V100'` or `'V100:2'`, where the `:2`
            indicates that the task requires 2 V100 GPUs. If a dict, must be a
            dict of the form `{'V100': 2}` or `{'tpu-v2-8': 1}`.
        accelerator_args: accelerator-specific arguments. For example,
            `{'tpu_vm': True, 'runtime_version': 'tpu-vm-base'}` for TPUs.
        use_spot: whether to use spot instances. If None, defaults to
            False.
        spot_recovery: the spot recovery strategy to use for the managed
            spot to recover the cluster from preemption. Refer to
            `recovery_strategy module <https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/blob/master/sky/spot/recovery_strategy.py>`__ # pylint: disable=line-too-long
            for more details.
        region: the region to use.
        zone: the zone to use.
        image_id: the image ID to use. If a str, must be a string
            of the image id from the cloud, such as AWS:
            ``'ami-1234567890abcdef0'``, GCP:
            ``'projects/my-project-id/global/images/my-image-name'``;
            Or, a image tag provided by SkyPilot, such as AWS:
            ``'skypilot:gpu-ubuntu-2004'``. If a dict, must be a dict mapping
            from region to image ID, such as:

            .. code-block:: python

                {
                'us-west1': 'ami-1234567890abcdef0',
                'us-east1': 'ami-1234567890abcdef0'
                }

        disk_size: the size of the OS disk in GiB.
        disk_tier: the disk performance tier to use. If None, defaults to
            ``'medium'``.

        cluster_name: name of the cluster to create/reuse.  If None,
            auto-generate a name.
        retry_until_up: whether to retry launching the cluster until it is
            up.
        idle_minutes_to_autostop: automatically stop the cluster after this
            many minute of idleness, i.e., no running or pending jobs in the
            cluster's job queue. Idleness gets reset whenever setting-up/
            running/pending jobs are found in the job queue. Setting this
            flag is equivalent to running
            ``sky.launch(..., detach_run=True, ...)`` and then
            ``sky.autostop(idle_minutes=<minutes>)``. If not set, the cluster
            will not be autostopped.
        down: Tear down the cluster after all jobs finish (successfully or
            abnormally). If --idle-minutes-to-autostop is also set, the
            cluster will be torn down after the specified idle time.
            Note that if errors occur during provisioning/data syncing/setting
            up, the cluster will not be torn down for debugging purposes.
        stream_logs: if True, show the logs in the terminal.
        docker_run_args: Optional arguments to pass to the `docker run` command
            running inside the VM.
