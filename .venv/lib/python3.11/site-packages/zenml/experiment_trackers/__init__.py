"""Experiment trackers let you track your ML experiments.

They log the parameters used and allow you to compare between runs. In the ZenML
world, every pipeline run is considered an experiment, and ZenML facilitates the
storage of experiment results through ExperimentTracker stack components. This
establishes a clear link between pipeline runs and experiments.
