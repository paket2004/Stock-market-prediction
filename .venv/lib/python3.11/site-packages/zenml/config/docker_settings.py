    Build process:
    --------------
    * No `dockerfile` specified: If any of the options regarding
    requirements, environment variables or copying files require us to build an
    image, ZenML will build this image. Otherwise the `parent_image` will be
    used to run the pipeline.
    * `dockerfile` specified: ZenML will first build an image based on the
    specified Dockerfile. If any of the options regarding
    requirements, environment variables or copying files require an additional
    image built on top of that, ZenML will build a second image. If not, the
    image build from the specified Dockerfile will be used to run the pipeline.

    Requirements installation order:
    --------------------------------
    Depending on the configuration of this object, requirements will be
    installed in the following order (each step optional):
    - The packages installed in your local python environment
    - The packages specified via the `requirements` attribute
    - The packages specified via the `required_integrations` and potentially
      stack requirements
    - The packages specified via the `required_hub_plugins` attribute

    Attributes:
        parent_image: Full name of the Docker image that should be
            used as the parent for the image that will be built. Defaults to
            a ZenML image built for the active Python and ZenML version.

            Additional notes:
            * If you specify a custom image here, you need to make sure it has
            ZenML installed.
            * If this is a non-local image, the environment which is running
            the pipeline and building the Docker image needs to be able to pull
            this image.
            * If a custom `dockerfile` is specified for this settings
            object, this parent image will be ignored.
        dockerfile: Path to a custom Dockerfile that should be built. Depending
            on the other values you specify in this object, the resulting
            image will be used directly to run your pipeline or ZenML will use
            it as a parent image to build on top of. See the general docstring
            of this class for more information.

            Additional notes:
            * If you specify this, the `parent_image` attribute will be ignored.
            * If you specify this, the image built from this Dockerfile needs
            to have ZenML installed.
        build_context_root: Build context root for the Docker build, only used
            when the `dockerfile` attribute is set. If this is left empty, the
            build context will only contain the Dockerfile.
        build_options: Additional options that will be passed unmodified to the
            Docker build call when building an image using the specified
            `dockerfile`. You can use this to for example specify build
            args or a target stage. See
            https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/images.html#docker.models.images.ImageCollection.build
            for a full list of available options.
        skip_build: If set to `True`, the parent image will be used directly to
            run the steps of your pipeline.
        target_repository: Name of the Docker repository to which the
            image should be pushed. This repository will be appended to the
            registry URI of the container registry of your stack and should
            therefore **not** include any registry.
        python_package_installer: The package installer to use for python
            packages.
        python_package_installer_args: Arguments to pass to the python package
            installer.
        replicate_local_python_environment: If not `None`, ZenML will use the
            specified method to generate a requirements file that replicates
            the packages installed in the currently running python environment.
            This requirements file will then be installed in the Docker image.
        requirements: Path to a requirements file or a list of required pip
            packages. During the image build, these requirements will be
            installed using pip. If you need to use a different tool to
            resolve and/or install your packages, please use a custom parent
            image or specify a custom `dockerfile`.
        required_integrations: List of ZenML integrations that should be
            installed. All requirements for the specified integrations will
            be installed inside the Docker image.
        required_hub_plugins: List of ZenML Hub plugins to install.
            Expected format: '(<author_username>/)<plugin_name>==<version>'.
            If no version is specified, the latest version is taken. The
            packages of required plugins and all their dependencies will be
            installed inside the Docker image.
        install_stack_requirements: If `True`, ZenML will automatically detect
            if components of your active stack are part of a ZenML integration
            and install the corresponding requirements and apt packages.
            If you set this to `False` or use custom components in your stack,
            you need to make sure these get installed by specifying them in
            the `requirements` and `apt_packages` attributes.
        apt_packages: APT packages to install inside the Docker image.
        environment: Dictionary of environment variables to set inside the
            Docker image.
        dockerignore: Path to a dockerignore file to use when building the
            Docker image.
        copy_files: DEPRECATED, use the `source_files` attribute instead.
        copy_global_config: DEPRECATED/UNUSED.
        user: If not `None`, will set the user, make it owner of the `/app`
            directory which contains all the user code and run the container
            entrypoint as this user.
        source_files: Defines how the user source files will be handled when
            building the Docker image.
            * INCLUDE: The files will be included in the Docker image.
            * DOWNLOAD: The files will be downloaded when running the image. If
              this is specified, the files must be inside a registered code
              repository and the repository must have no local changes,
              otherwise the build will fail.
            * DOWNLOAD_OR_INCLUDE: The files will be downloaded if they're
              inside a registered code repository and the repository has no
              local changes, otherwise they will be included in the image.
            * IGNORE: The files will not be included or downloaded in the image.
              If you use this option, you're responsible that all the files
              to run your steps exist in the right place.
