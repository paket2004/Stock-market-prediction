# morelorless

This is a thin wrapper around `difflib.unified_diff` that Does The Right Thing
for "No newline at eof".  The args are also simplified compared to `difflib`:

```py
moreorless.unified_diff(
    astr: str,
    bstr: str,
    filename: str,
    n: int = 3,
) -> str:
    ...

# raises moreorless.patch.PatchException
moreorless.patch.apply_single_file(
    contents: str,
    patch: str,
    allow_offsets: bool = True,
) -> str:
    ...

# uses click to write to stdout with colors
moreorless.click.echo_color_unified_diff(
    astr: str,
    bstr: str,
    filename: str,
    n: int = 3
) -> None:
    ...

# if you want to use unified_diff yourself first (e.g. in another process)
moreorless.click.echo_color_precomputed_diff(
    diff: str,
) -> None:
    ...
```
